PRE-PROJECT CONCEPTS AND GOALS

This is the Recipes project tought in the Foundations section of the Odin Project

This project will reflect my understanding of essential HTML concepts such as boilerplates, elemenets, tags, and links.

POST PROJECT RETROSPECTIVES

After finishing the project, I feel confident in my desire to lean HTML.

The work was tedious though I'm sure I'll discover shortcuts in the future that mitigate the repeated texts.

Also I realized during this project that I might have undiagnosed ADHD so that's cool.
